					<div class="caption text-center"> <h3>Brief Biography of Dennis Ritchie 1941-2011</h3>
						<div class="text-justify"><h4><Strong>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie</Strong> (<em>September 9, 1941 â€“October 12, 2011</em>) was an American computer scientist.He created the <Strong><em>C</em></Strong> programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the <Strong><em>Unix</em></Strong> operating system. Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username <Strong>dmr</Strong>. Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed. He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease.</h4>

							<h3>Without Dennis Ritchie's Contribution, the Following wont be possible:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li> Without <Strong>dmr</Strong>  there would not be C programming language and Unix operating system.</li>
								<li>Without C there would be no C++ used to the develop of Windows </li>
								<li>Without Unix there would be Linux</li>
								<li>Without C, there would be no iOS, the software powering all Apple Gadgets</li>
								<li>Without Unix, there will be Internet Servers</li>
								<li>Without the work of dmr there will be microprocessors that will be used to power the keyboad I using to type this</li>
								<li>Without the work of dmr, </li>
								<li>Modern computing as we know it would not have existed without Dennis Ritchie</li>
								<li>Without his contributions, it's likely none of us would be using personal computers today, sophisticated software applications or even a modern Internet.</li>

								<li>Here, take a look at this <a href="http://www.lextrait.com/vincent/implementations.html"http://www.lextrait.com/vincent/implementations.html>table</a> of what programming languages are used to implement popular software. Note how heavily populated are the C column and, next to it, the column for C++, which was developed as an enhanced C.</li>
